# How to Spot a Spotted Cat

The Challenge is to develop a system or tool to significantly reduce the time needed to examine camera trap images 
in the field to determine if they contain a spotted cat. These images are typically from 100 kilobytes to 4 megabytes in size and 
may be color or monochrome. Typically, less than 1% contain a spotted cat, although this proportion can vary 
depending on the location of the survey.  The image file format is usually jpg but may vary.
  
Typical users of the system or tool will have access to a laptop PC but limited or no access to the internet.  
The focus of this Challenge is on large spotted cats: jaguar, leopard, cheetah, snow leopard, 
Eurasian lynx, and clouded leopard â€“ please see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_cat for more information on this selection.


## Technical Requirements:

1.	Identify the images that contain a spotted cat
2.	Be open source and freely distributable to researchers in the field
3.	Have the ability to run on a common laptop PC with limited or no internet access
4.	Process images of 100 kilobytes to 4 megabytes in jpg format
5.	Process 1000 images per day

Additionally, attributes that are desired but not required include:
6.	Limited human involvement in the process
7.	Low false positive count
8.	Potentially extensible to other species

## Deliverables

The deliverable for this Challenge is a demonstrable solution (including source code and dependent software, and supporting documentation) that is able to:

1.	Accept images in jpg format and ranging in size from 100 kilobytes to 4 megabytes
2.	Identify the images that contain a spotted cat
3.	Be freely distributable to researchers in the field
4.	Process 1000 images per day running on a common laptop PC with limited or no internet access

Submissions should include the following:

1.	Detailed description of the proposed solution and how it addresses the overall goal of this Challenge and the specific capabilities desired in the Technical Requirements listed above.
2.	Source code and dependent software for any software used in the solution
3.	Detailed set-up instructions for configuring and running the solution
4.	Binary executable compatible with a Windows XP platform
5.	If possible, a video of a WebEx demo of the software in use
